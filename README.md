# Music-Genre-Classification
The following code deploys a CNN based algorithm deploying the Tensorflow framework. 
In the first part of the code we used the librosa library to extract various features out of an a audio signal. 
In the next part a model using CNN cells is used to train the generated samples into 10 categories.
Full implementation in the jupyter notebook is shown.
